# Decision log

Append-only, newest at the bottom. Log any choice a future reader would otherwise have to rediscover: architecture, libraries, data model, trade-offs. Owner decisions are tagged `[owner]`, agent decisions `[agent]`.

Template:

```
### D-000: Title (YYYY-MM-DD) [owner|agent]
Context: what forced the choice
Decision: what we chose
Alternatives considered: what we did not choose, and why
Consequences / revisit when: what this commits us to
```

### D-001: Adopt the governed workflow (2026-10-22) [owner]
Context: Iterations were producing more bugs than they were worth, and it was unclear whether the build was still following the original direction.
Decision: All work goes through architect, implementer, check gate, reviewer and QA. `docs/SPEC.md` is the locked direction and `docs/ROADMAP.md` defines done.
Alternatives considered: Continuing with a single agent plus owner review only.
Consequences / revisit when: Revisit if the pipeline overhead is larger than the bugs it prevents. `/progress` and `/audit` should show this.
