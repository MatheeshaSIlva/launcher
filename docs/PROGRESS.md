# Progress and device results

Results from the real app on the Galaxy S24 (Android 16). Only what a device log or Matheesha confirmed counts as passed.

## Task 1: project skeleton (commit 9695df8), passed 2026-10-04

- CI built and published the rolling `latest` release; phone ran `BUILD 9695df8` (matches the commit).
- Shizuku: binder received, permission dialog, granted, user service connected; `identity` = `uid=2000 pid=13210 android=16 sdk=36 device=samsung SM-S921B`.
- Updater version check: correctly reported "already on the newest build". **Not yet tested:** the actual download + silent install (needs a newer build than the installed one; tested with task 2).

## Task 2: safe settings + Restore notification (in test)

Design:
- Restore = animation scales back to the values saved before we changed them (default 1.0) + `cmd statusbar send-disable-flag none`.
- When Shizuku connects, the app self-grants `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` and `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (`pm grant`). After that, animation scales can be
  restored with no Shizuku at all. Status bar flags can only be cleared by the shell: without Shizuku the answer is a reboot (or the watchdog, task 3).
- Persistent safety notification with **Restore system** and **Safe settings** actions; the safe-settings screen is a fixed stock-widget screen with its own
  app-drawer entry ("Launcher safe settings") and own task.
